    <h2>Self As System</h2>
      <p>For this project, I set out to create a visual representation of how music shapes my identity. Out of all the data I collected, I chose to focus on my Spotify history because it most directly reflects my habits, moods, and personal rhythms. I began by creating an abstract “music vibe chart” in Adobe Illustrator, which I integrated as the background image for my website. From there, I extracted the names of artists from my data and programmed them to appear randomly across the screen, continuously in motion.</p>

      <p>This concept draws inspiration from Jenny Holzer’s Light Line installation at the Guggenheim. Experiencing that work, I was struck by how the flowing text commanded attention. The words themselves were static, yet their movement across space forced my eyes to follow, creating a sense of urgency that demanded engagement. That intensity of motion stayed with me, and I sought to recreate a similar experience within my own work.</p>
        
      <p>On my website, the artist names I listen to stream across the screen at varying speeds. Some move quickly, pulling the viewer’s focus, while others drift more slowly, offering moments of pause. This interplay of fast and slow creates a visual rhythm that mirrors the dynamic range of music itself. By layering these movements, I aim to capture both the immediacy and the lingering resonance of sound. Ultimately, this work visualizes the ways music forms connections—between different genres, between myself and my listening habits, and between my experience and the viewer’s.</p>

    <h2>Spotify Data Reflection</h3>
      <p>Looking at my Spotify data, I noticed that it captures a surprisingly wide range of genres. The breakdown shows high energy EDM and DJ mixes on one end, calm and soothing tracks on the other, and even something as niche as Mongolian throat singing. At first, the variety felt random, but the data reflects the way I actually use music in my daily life. I listen almost everywhere I go and during almost anything I do, so the genres shift depending on my mood, energy, or activity. What stood out to me is that despite this diversity, patterns still emerge. When I compare artists across genres, I can see recurring similarities—whether in vibe, style, or emotional tone. The data suggests that I’m consistently drawn to music that carries a certain kind of energy, even if it comes from very different categories.</p>

      <p>Another detail the data highlights is my strong pull toward RnB. I follow multiple RnB producers across different languages and cultural backgrounds, which shows up clearly in my listening history. This reinforced for me how music isn’t confined by language or ethnicity. Even if I don’t understand every lyric, the rhythm, melody, and emotional quality create a connection.Overall, the data shows that my listening isn’t just scattered it’s patterned, expressive, and deeply personal. It reminds me that music works as a universal language, one that connects across boundaries and creates harmony in diversity.</p>
